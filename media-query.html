                    Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; 
                    he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that 
                    knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his 
                    desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy 
                    or remorse of conscience.

                    And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray 
                    unto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light 
                    of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as 
                    white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and 
                    behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, 
                    even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness 
                    thereof.
